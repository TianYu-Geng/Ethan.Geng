### 🔬 Research Interests

- 🤖 **Embodied Intelligence**: Bridging perception, cognition, and control in complex physical environments    
- 👁️ **Computer Vision**: Focused on multimodal image fusion, 3D perception, and object detection/tracking across visual and spatial domains     
- 🧬 **Trustworthy and Intelligent Navigation for Surgical Robots**: Focusing on reliable and intelligent navigation in surgical robotics, integrates multimodal perception fusion and reinforcement learning frameworks to construct real-time dynamic spatial mapping models. It achieves sub-millimeter-level pose correction and tissue deformation compensation, and establishes a multi-dimensional trust evaluation system covering operational safety, path compliance, and decision interpretability. The goal is to enable high-precision, disturbance-resilient navigation for interventional surgery, ensuring safety and efficiency in human-robot collaborative procedures.
